# Task 1: Software configuration.

## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I was very happy when I saw the advertisement of this project. 
For me personally, this is a great opportunity for development, mastering an interesting and in-demand profession. 
I have long liked the field of IT, but the education is expensive. 
This project will help me take the first steps towards IT.

I plan to get all the information I can to further develop myself or look for a job. 
Communicating in English will help me improve my language skills. 
Of course, the best way to complete your studies will be the opportunity to complete an internship at a Polish company. 
But even without this, I will get valuable knowledge and a little testing experience.
